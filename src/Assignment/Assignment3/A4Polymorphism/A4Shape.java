/* Assignment: Create a class "Shape" with a method "area()" that returns 0. Create 
another class "Rectangle" that inherits from the "Shape" class and overrides the 
area() method to calculate and return the area of a rectangle. Create another class 
"Circle" that also inherits from the "Shape" class and overrides the area() method to 
calculate and return the area of a circle. Finally, create a class "TestShape" that 
creates an object of each of the "Rectangle" and "Circle" classes and calculates the 
area of each of them using the area() method. */
